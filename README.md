# Functional_and_Structural_Networks
This is all the code used in the paper: "What do Functional Synchronization Networks Indicate About Underlying Structure and System Dynamics? A network theory study of the islet." by Briggs et al.



To run 'basic network analysis: (plot histogram and adjacency matrix)
>> links.m

To find "optimal threshold" using fmi search
>> findoptRt.m

To get clustering and efficiency: 
>> graphProperties.m

To view networks: 
>> Show_network*.m
