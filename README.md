# Functional_and_Structural_Networks
This directory is used for running network analysis on time courses. Particularly, this code was developed for calcium and electrical signals in the Islets of Langerhans but may be used for other systems.

Managed by Jennifer Briggs 2022.

## Folder 2022Islet

This is all the code used in the paper: "What do Functional Synchronization Networks Indicate About Underlying Structure and System Dynamics? A network theory study of the islet." by Briggs et al.


To run 'basic network analysis: (plot histogram and adjacency matrix)
>> links.m

To find "optimal threshold" using fmi search
>> findoptRt.m

To get clustering and efficiency: 
>> graphProperties.m

To view networks: 
>> Show_network*.m
