# Functional_and_Structural_Networks
This directory is used for running network analysis on time courses. Particularly, this code was developed for calcium and electrical signals in the Islets of Langerhans but may be used for other systems.

Managed by Jennifer Briggs 2022.

## Folder 2022Islet

This is all the code used in the paper: "Î²-Cell intrinsic dynamics rather than gap junction structure dictates subpopulations in the islet functional network." by Briggs et al eLife 2023.


To run 'basic network analysis: (plot histogram and adjacency matrix)
>> links.m

To find "optimal threshold" using fmi search
>> findoptRt.m

To get clustering and efficiency: 
>> graphProperties.m

To view networks: 
>> Show_network*.m
